6. Live Co‚ÄëCounsel Chat + AI Memory
Overview
This system serves as a hybrid legal chat assistant and memory engine that operates in real-time with human collaborators. It provides instant access to case knowledge, structured memory, and collaborative tools‚Äîall grounded in your document and graph data.

üîß System Architecture
A. Conversation and Memory Layer
Database Models (PostgreSQL or equivalent)

Conversation: tracks a thread/session with unique ID, participants, and timestamps.

Message: linked to a conversation, stores:

sender_id

content

timestamp

document_ids: optional, linked evidence

reply_to: message threading

visibility: enum (private, shared)

Vector Memory Index (ChromaDB or Qdrant)

Store vector embeddings of each message.

Store embedding references to linked documents or facts (IDs, case topics).

Graph Context Cache (Neo4j)

Messages create or enhance edges between:

Witness ‚Üî Document

Topic ‚Üî Conversation

Fact ‚Üî Attorney Input

B. AI Co-Counsel Agent
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

On every query:

Retrieve relevant documents (via ChromaDB)

Retrieve associated graph context (via Neo4j)

Include recent messages (conversation memory window)

Prompt LLM using:

[Query] + [Top k messages] + [Graph insights] + [Semantic documents]

Supported Commands

"Search all docs mentioning 'X'"

"Summarize facts from March"

"Show timeline of party interactions"

"Suggest legal theory from current facts"

Agent Memory

Update memory store with every agent response

Allow forget, recall, and mark as important commands from user

C. Front-End Integration
Real-Time Chat UI

Built with WebSockets or Socket.IO

Features:

Message threads

Typing indicators

Identity tags (You, Co-Counsel, AI Agent)

Filter by public/private/shared

Message Enhancements

Attach Document (auto-links to vector + Neo4j)

Tag Topic (e.g., ‚ÄúMotion to Compel‚Äù, ‚ÄúCustody‚Äù)

Add to Outline or Flag for Review

Searchable Chat Archive

Full-text search with filters (date, sender, linked document, topic)

Exportable log (with or without privileged messages)

D. Audit & Compliance
All messages are timestamped and immutable.

Redaction tool integrated into message view (optional).

Privilege tagging at message level (auto + manual).

Daily snapshot logs for forensic review.

üß† Advanced Enhancements (Future)
Thread Summarization Agent: Live summarizer of conversation threads.

Voice-to-Text Support: Dictation feature with inline summarization.

Multimodal Input: Accepts screenshots, scanned exhibits, annotated PDFs.
