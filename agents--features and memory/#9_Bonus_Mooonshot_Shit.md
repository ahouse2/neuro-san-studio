🌕 Bonus Moonshots — Technical Architecture & Plan
1. Court Filing Auto-Drafter
Goal: Auto-generate legal motions based on known facts, legal theories, and templates.

📑 Template Engine
Use Jinja2 or docx-mailmerge for inserting facts into prebuilt motion templates.

Templates contain slots like:

{{ factual_background }}

{{ legal_argument_elements }}

⚙️ Drafting Pipeline
Select motion type (e.g., Motion to Compel, MSJ).

Pull:

Factual narrative (facts table / vector matches).

Relevant legal theories (legal_theory table / Neo4j).

Cited authorities from legal_reference table.

Use a language model (e.g., gpt-4o, Gemini) to fill in sections:

Prompted with the document's outline

Fills in boilerplate, integrates cited facts, etc.

🛠 Manual Review & Export
UI: “Generated Draft Preview” editor

Export to Word or PDF

Add attorney “final sign-off” for audit trail

2. Pretrial Statement Generator
Goal: Assemble comprehensive pretrial statements from known data.

📋 Content Pulled From:
Stipulated Facts: Approved facts in timeline_event or stipulation table

Contested Issues: Flagged via contradiction detection or user labels

Witnesses & Exhibits: From Witness and Document/Evidence models

🧠 Generator Logic
Structured builder with predefined sections:

Parties, Facts, Issues, Witnesses, Exhibits

Optional LLM polishing for natural phrasing

🖥 UI
Pre-built template editor with auto-populated content

Checkbox to mark each section as “Reviewed”

Export: Preformatted for CA Judicial Council or local court forms

3. Evidence Scorecard
Goal: Let users rank evidence based on legal usefulness

🧮 Scoring Components
Probative Value – TF-IDF / embedding match to key issues

Admissibility Risk – Use rule-based tags (e.g., hearsay, privilege, relevance)

Narrative Alignment – Match doc to preferred factual theory

🧠 ML / Heuristics
Optional ML classifier trained on annotated trial docs (public opinions, open-source discovery data)

Scoring example:

json
Copy code
{
  "probative_value": 8.7,
  "admissibility_risk": 2.3,
  "narrative_alignment": 9.2
}
📊 UI
Column sorting in document review table

Visual meters (e.g., green/yellow/red)

Filter: “Show top-scoring exhibits for theory X”

4. Chat-Style Timeline Builder
Goal: Build a timeline conversationally.

🗣 Interaction Format
Input: “Add meeting between John and Mary on May 4 about custody”

Output: New TimelineEvent node with parsed participants, date, and topic

🧠 NLP Pipeline
Use dateparser + named entity recognition + intent classification

Structure message → insert into timeline DB/graph

🔁 Bi-Directional Chat
“What happened in March?” → returns chronological summary of events

“Show me inconsistencies in May events” → integrates with contradiction system

📌 Integration
Links to deposition prep:

“Generate questions from March events”

Sync with document nodes:

Timeline event links to supporting doc excerpts

🚀 Next Steps for Implementation
Choose which Moonshot to prioritize

I'd suggest Evidence Scorecard or Court Drafter for immediate client wow-factor.

Spin out agents/tools for each subsystem

Separate your LLM prompts, template engines, score calculators, and NLP pipelines.

Integrate into the UI cleanly

Hide advanced features behind “Enable Experimental Features?” toggle.
