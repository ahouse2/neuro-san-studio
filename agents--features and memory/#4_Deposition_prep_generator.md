Improved Prompt: Comprehensive Deposition Preparation Automation Plan

Objective:
Develop an automated system for generating deposition outlines by efficiently linking witnesses to relevant documents, extracting pertinent facts, and formulating tailored question sets based on the evidence available. This plan will guide the coding agent in implementing the necessary features and functionalities using advanced AI models, specifically Codex or ChatGPT.

1. Witness-Document Linking
Enhancement of NLP Pipeline
Tools: Utilize spaCy with a custom legal model or Hugging Face transformers optimized for entity linking and relation extraction.

Process Steps:

Named Entity Recognition (NER) & Role Classification:

Implement a tagging system during document ingestion to identify and classify entities into roles such as Witness, Party, Lawyer, Expert, and Judge.
Leverage dependency parsing or relation extraction techniques (e.g., spaCy’s ent_rel patterns or REBEL with transformers) to establish connections between entities and their corresponding actions/facts.
Data Storage Strategy:

PostgreSQL Implementation:

Create a witnesses table to store the following attributes:
id, name, role, associated_case, linked_user_id
Establish a many-to-many (M:N) relationship table called document_witness_link to connect documents and witnesses.
Neo4j Graph Database Setup:

Define nodes for Witness with properties {name, role}.
Establish edges to represent relationships:
(:Document)-[:MENTIONS|LINKED_TO]->(:Witness)
(:Fact)-[:ASSERTED_BY]->(:Witness)
2. Fact & Evidence Aggregation
Evidence Corpus Development

Build or query from:
Facts extracted during the document ingestion process.
Vector search results to identify document similarities.
Entity-aware chunking to maintain contextual integrity of facts.
Consistency Checking Mechanism:

Implement a contradiction detection system using an entailment model (e.g., RoBERTa trained on MNLI) to identify conflicting timelines or conclusions between documents and witnesses. Flag these inconsistencies for further review.
3. Question Generation Module
File Structure:

Create a Python file named deposition_prep.py.
Input Parameters:

witness_id
Optional parameters: scope (date range, Bates range, topic)
Processing Steps:

Retrieve all facts and documents associated with the specified witness.
Organize the retrieved information into categories:
Chronology
Subject Matter
Legal Issue
Prompt Template for Question Generation:

You are preparing for a deposition of {witness_name}, who is mentioned in the following facts: {facts}. 
Based on this information, generate a comprehensive set of detailed questions categorized into:
1. Background
2. Events
3. Inconsistencies
4. Damages
Ensure to include source references (e.g., document name or Bates number) for each question. Aim to generate 10-20 questions per witness using the capabilities of Codex/ChatGPT.
4. UI/UX Integration
User Interface Design:

New Tab: “Deposition Prep”
Sidebar Features:

Dropdown menu for selecting Case and Witness.
Checkbox option: “Include documents marked as privileged?”
Button: “Generate Questions”
Main Panel Features:

Editable question list with inline references to linked documents/facts.
Action buttons: “Regenerate”, “Flag Fact”, “Export Outline”
Export Functionality:

Implement PDF or Word export options using libraries such as python-docx or WeasyPrint. The export should include:
Witness name
Case ID
Timestamp
Numbered questions
Bates references as hyperlinked footnotes.
5. Audit & Human Review
Permissions Management:

Restrict approval and export capabilities to attorneys or case administrators.
Create a review log table (deposition_review_log) with the following schema:
reviewer_id, timestamp, approved, notes, witness_id
6. Optional Enhancements (Stretch Goals)
Feature	Description
Topic Heatmap	Visualize the intensity of topics associated with each witness.
Reinforcement Loop	Allow attorneys to provide feedback on question quality to refine the model.
Salient Docs First	Prioritize document ranking by relevance to the witness using centrality or vector relevance techniques.
Contradiction Mode	Display pairs of facts with a risk score for potential contradictions.
Desired Output:
A step-by-step, detailed, and comprehensive technical plan of action for building an automated deposition preparation tool, tailored for Codex or ChatGPT. The plan should be clear enough to direct a coding agent through implementation, ensuring all components are covered and optimized for legal use cases.
