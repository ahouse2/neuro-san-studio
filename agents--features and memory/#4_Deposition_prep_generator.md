✅ Deposition Prep Generator: Technical Plan of Action
GOAL:
Automate deposition outlines by linking witnesses to documents, extracting facts, and generating question sets based on available evidence.

1. Witness–Document Linking
📌 NLP Pipeline Enhancement
Tooling: spaCy (custom legal model), or HuggingFace transformer with entity linking.

Process:

NER + Role Classifier: During ingestion, tag all people in the document and classify their role:

Witness, Party, Lawyer, Expert, Judge, etc.

Use dependency parsing or relation extraction (e.g. via spaCy’s ent_rel patterns or transformers with REBEL) to connect entities to actions/facts.

📌 Data Storage
PostgreSQL:

witnesses table: stores names, roles, associated case, linked user ID if available.

document_witness_link: M:N table linking docs and witnesses.

Neo4j Graph:

Nodes: (Witness {name, role})

Edges:

(:Document)-[:MENTIONS|LINKED_TO]->(:Witness)

(:Fact)-[:ASSERTED_BY]->(:Witness)

2. Fact & Evidence Aggregation
📌 Evidence Corpus
Build or query from:

Facts extracted during ingestion

Vector search results for document similarity

Entity-aware chunking (keep facts and context together)

📌 Consistency Checking
Use contradiction detection (e.g. via entailment model like RoBERTa trained on MNLI):

Detect when two docs/witnesses state conflicting timelines or conclusions.

Flag for review.

3. Question Generation Module
📌 File: deposition_prep.py
a. Input:
witness_id

Optional: scope (date range, Bates range, topic)

b. Steps:
Pull all facts/docs tied to witness.

Bucket by:

Chronology

Subject Matter

Legal Issue

Use prompt template:

pgsql
Copy code
You are preparing for a deposition of {witness_name}, who is mentioned in the following facts: {facts}.
Generate detailed questions grouped by category: background, events, inconsistencies, damages.
Include source reference (e.g. document name or Bates number) for each.
Generate 10–20 questions per witness using:

Claude 3 / GPT-4 / Gemini (adjust prompt to your LLM)

Optionally fine-tune a mini LLM for local usage

4. UI/UX Integration
📌 Tabs & Panels
New Tab: “Deposition Prep”

Sidebar:

Dropdown: Select Case → Witness

Checkbox: “Include documents marked as privileged?”

Button: “Generate Questions”

Main Panel:

Editable question list

Inline reference to linked document/fact

Buttons: “Regenerate”, “Flag Fact”, “Export Outline”

📌 Export
PDF or Word export via python-docx or WeasyPrint

Include:

Witness name, case ID

Timestamp

Question numbering

Bates refs (as hyperlinked footnotes)

5. Audit & Human Review
📌 Permissions:
Only attorneys or case admins can approve or export questions.

Add a review log (table: deposition_review_log) with:

reviewer_id, timestamp, approved, notes, witness_id
