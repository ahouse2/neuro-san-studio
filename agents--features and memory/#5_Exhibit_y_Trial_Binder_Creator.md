### Prompt Structure

1. **Introduction**
   - Provide an in-depth overview of the project, emphasizing the goal of developing a real-time legal chat assistant that synergizes human expertise with AI memory functionalities. Discuss the significance of immediate access to case knowledge and the organization of structured memory for legal professionals.

2. **System Architecture Overview**
   - Detail the primary components of the system architecture, including:
     - **Conversation and Memory Layer**
     - **AI Co-Counsel Agent**
     - **Front-End Integration**
     - **Audit & Compliance Framework**
   - Highlight how these components interact to create a seamless user experience.

3. **Detailed Component Breakdown**
   - **A. Conversation and Memory Layer**
     - **Database Models (PostgreSQL or equivalent)**
       - Define the schema for the `Conversation` and `Message` tables, specifying data types, constraints, and relationships. Include examples for clarity:
         - `Conversation`: `id (UUID)`, `participants (ARRAY of user_ids)`, `created_at (TIMESTAMP)`.
         - `Message`: `id (UUID)`, `conversation_id (UUID)`, `sender_id (UUID)`, `content (TEXT)`, `timestamp (TIMESTAMP)`, `document_ids (ARRAY of UUID)`, `reply_to (UUID)`, `visibility (ENUM)`.
     - **Vector Memory Index (ChromaDB or Qdrant)**
       - Describe the methodology for storing vector embeddings and linking them to relevant documents or facts, including the embedding generation process.
     - **Graph Context Cache (Neo4j)**
       - Elaborate on how to model relationships between messages, witnesses, documents, and topics using graph structures, including examples of potential queries.

   - **B. AI Co-Counsel Agent**
     - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System**
       - Provide a detailed workflow for processing user queries, specifying the steps for document retrieval from ChromaDB and graph context retrieval from Neo4j. 
       - Define the format for prompting the LLM, including:
         - Example: `Prompt = [User Query] + [Top K Messages] + [Graph Insights] + [Semantic Documents]`.
     - **Supported Commands**
       - Enumerate and describe commands the agent should support, providing examples of input and expected output for each.

   - **C. Front-End Integration**
     - **Real-Time Chat UI**
       - Specify the technology stack for the chat interface (e.g., WebSockets or Socket.IO) and outline UI features such as message threading, typing indicators, and identity tags.
     - **Message Enhancements**
       - Detail features for attaching documents, tagging topics, and adding messages to outlines, including user interface considerations.
     - **Searchable Chat Archive**
       - Explain the implementation of full-text search capabilities, including filters for date, user, and topic, as well as options for exporting logs.

   - **D. Audit & Compliance**
     - Describe the mechanisms for timestamping messages, implementing redaction tools, and privilege tagging. 
     - Outline the daily snapshot logging process for forensic review, including how to ensure data integrity and compliance with legal standards.

4. **Advanced Enhancements (Future Considerations)**
   - Identify and outline potential advanced features for future development, such as:
     - Thread Summarization Agent
     - Voice-to-Text Support
     - Multimodal Input capabilities
   - Discuss the implications and benefits of each enhancement.

5. **Implementation Steps**
   - Provide a clear sequence of actionable steps for executing the project, including:
     - **Step 1:** Conduct requirements gathering and stakeholder interviews.
     - **Step 2:** Design the database schema and set up the database environment.
     - **Step 3:** Implement the conversation and memory layer, ensuring data integrity.
     - **Step 4:** Develop the AI Co-Counsel Agent and integrate RAG functionalities.
     - **Step 5:** Build the front-end chat interface, focusing on usability and performance.
     - **Step 6:** Establish audit and compliance protocols, ensuring legal adherence.
     - **Step 7:** Conduct thorough testing and validation of all components.
     - **Step 8:** Deploy the application and provide user training sessions.

6. **Conclusion**
   - Summarize the importance of each component in the overall system and articulate the expected impact of the hybrid legal chat assistant on enhancing legal practices and improving efficiency.
