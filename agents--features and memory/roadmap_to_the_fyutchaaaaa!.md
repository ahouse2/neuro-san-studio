### 1. **Automated Privilege Detection & Redaction**

**Problem:** Lawyers fear inadvertently producing privileged docs.
**Solution:**

* NLP-based model to **detect attorney–client communication** patterns
* Auto-redact names, emails, legal conclusions, etc.
* Flag “maybe privileged” docs for human review

→ You win serious trust points with legal teams.

---integration notes---

1. Automated Privilege Detection & Redaction
Model Choice & Data Pipeline

Use a legal-domain NER model (e.g. spaCy's “en_legal_ner_md”) fine-tuned for attorney-client patterns.

Pipeline: ingest → chunk → NER → privilege classifier → redact → persist redacted versions.

Redaction Layer

Implement redaction helpers (redaction.py) that take spans flagged as privileged and insert placeholders (e.g., “[REDACTED: Attorney-Client]”) in a copy of the text/PDF.

Keep a mapping of redactions to original text for internal use, but never export the original text when redactions are active.

Review & Audit

Add a “privileged?” flag in the document table.

Provide an interface for attorneys to override AI decisions and maintain an audit log (who/when/what).


### 2. **Real-Time Bates Stamping & Versioning**

**Problem:** Tracking document versions and compliance formats is a nightmare
**Solution:**

* Add real Bates numbers on ingest
* Track versions, edits, and audit trails
* Include hash comparison and differential metadata analysis

→ Chain of custody = clean. Forensic gold.

---integration notes---

2. Real-Time Bates Stamping & Versioning
Bates Number Service

Implement a monotonic counter in the DB (e.g., bates_counter table).

Upon ingest, assign Bates numbers to each page or doc.

Support custom prefixes/formatting (“ABCD_000001”).

Version Control

For each uploaded revision, hash the file and store as a new version.

Show diff/metadata between versions; maintain a chain-of-custody record (hash, ingest time, user).

Export & Compliance

PDF overlays with Bates numbers placed in margin headers/footers.

Command-line utility or UI action for “Bates stamp this set” to reprocess existing docs.


### 3. **Legal Theory Mapping**

**Problem:** Lawyers don’t just want facts, they want them **framed** in the right narrative
**Solution:**

* Use embeddings + graph analysis to group documents by:

  * Cause of action
  * Elements of proof
  * Factual support
* Auto-suggest legal theories that emerge from the evidence base

→ This moves you from document processor to **case strategy generator**.

--- integration notes---

3. Legal Theory Mapping (Core)
(You already have the plan; here’s the integration note.)

Complete ontology creation, fact extraction, graph persistence, suggestion engine, and UI per the prior roadmap.

Make sure privilege tags and Bates numbers flow into the Fact records so that theories respect privilege and can reference stamped pages.


### 4. **Deposition Prep Generator**

**Problem:** Deposition outlines take days
**Solution:**

* Cross-reference topics and documents with witness names
* Auto-suggest deposition questions based on documents tied to that person
* Flag inconsistencies or gaps in narrative

→ 1 day of prep becomes 15 minutes.

---integration notes---

4. Deposition Prep Generator
Witness–Document Linking

Enhance fact extraction to tag documents with participant names and roles (e.g., witness, party).

Maintain a Witness model tied to documents/facts in the DB and Neo4j.

Question Generation

Implement deposition_prep.py which:

For each witness, retrieves associated facts.

Prompts a language model to generate question clusters (background, event chronology, contradictions, damages).

Allows manual edits/approval in the UI.

UI/Export

New tab “Deposition Prep” with witness selector.

Export to PDF/Word outlines with question numbering, Bates references, and doc links.


### 5. **Exhibit & Trial Binder Creator**

**Problem:** Lawyers scramble to assemble final exhibits
**Solution:**

* Let user “tag for exhibit” as they review docs
* Auto-build numbered exhibit list, generate PDFs with cover sheets
* Integrate with trial presentation tools (TrialPad, OnCue)

---integration notes---

5. Exhibit & Trial Binder Creator
Tagging & Management

Add “Exhibit” tag to documents; maintain order/index.

UI checkbox “Mark as Exhibit” in document view.

Binder Generation

Tool to compile exhibits into a binder:

Adds cover sheets with exhibit number and title.

Ensures Bates numbers are visible; cross-check for privilege.

Integration

Provide export options (PDF binder, zip of files).

Optional integration hooks for TrialPad/OnCue formats.


### 6. **Live Co-Counsel Chat + AI Memory**

**Problem:** Teams lose context across tools, emails, notes
**Solution:**

* Build an AI co-counsel agent that:

  * Knows everything uploaded
  * Can answer questions live (“show me all texts between X and Y on March 3”)
  * Tracks conversation threads between humans and agents

→ Think **Notion + Slack + Paralegal + Memory**.

---integration notes---

6. Live Co‑Counsel Chat + AI Memory
Conversation Store

Add Conversation and Message models with user identity and time stamps.

Maintain context windows referencing doc IDs and facts.

AI Agent

Commands: “search docs”, “summarize facts”, “suggest theories”, etc.

Team Collaboration

Real‑time WebSocket-based chat with typing indicators and shared context.

Option to mark messages as private or shared.


### 7. **Forensic Chain of Custody Dashboard**

**Problem:** Law firms don’t have good chain-of-custody tracking
**Solution:**

* Dashboard showing ingestion time, hash, processing time, failure logs, file lineage
* Exportable for evidentiary hearings

---integration notes---

### 8. **Opposition Document Tracker**

**Problem:** Litigants can’t always tell what opposing counsel produced
**Solution:**

* Tag uploaded files as “Received from Opposing Counsel”
* Auto-check for duplicates in user files
* Compare narratives between sides (“they claim X, our docs say Y”)

---integration notes---

8. Opposition Document Tracker
Flagging Opposing Docs

Add a “source” field on docs (user, opp_counsel, court, etc.).

On ingest, user marks doc as “Received from Opposing Counsel.”
