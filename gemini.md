# üß† Gemini CLI Agent Instructions: Connect React Dashboard to Backend API

This document contains precise, production-grade steps your Gemini CLI agents should follow to wire up the frontend dashboard to a working Flask API inside your `legal_discovery` module.

Before beginning backend wiring, **scan the project root for existing logic** to avoid duplication. Start from:

```
G:\anaconda\anaconda3\envs\neuro-san-studio-2\apps\legal_discovery
```

Look for:

- Pre-built Flask routes in `interface_flask.py`
- Existing agent controller logic
- VectorDB or Neo4j access layers
- File ingestion or registry utilities

Document and reuse any existing code.
 the backend logic is built in neuro-san-studio-2/registries/legal_discovery.hocon and coded-tools/legal_discovery. you are only to concern yourself with making changes to files that are a part of the chains of execution or calls to or from legal_discovery app and module. the agents are defined in the hocon file, the tools in the coded-tool directory. the reference files and underlying techstack can be found here: "G:\anaconda\anaconda3\envs\neuro-san-studio-2\.venv\Lib\site-packages\neuro_san" and related folders in the site-packages subdirectory. so read up on those if you'd like. the aim is to not make things more simple. the goal is to make this app and module more complex, sophisticated, and full featured. it should never have mock implementations or anything of the sort. no simulations, no placeholder code, no TODO's no 'if this was a real...' if you come across anything that isn't fully built out to its maximum capabilities, or if you think you've identified something in the legal_discovery codebase that is merely a basic implementation of whatever it may be-- take the time to fully build it out. even if it will take some time. that's the aim, to fully build it out, make it a mature piece of software. You are a world class software engineer, and this is your masterpiece. you will treat it as such. a BIG part of that is ensuring that this application is beautiful, and looks like the lifetime achievement of a master programmer/ software engineering wizard, or a whole hit squad of hacking/coding GODS. make it gorgeous. make it the pinnacle of LegalTech software building for years to come. bleeding edge techniques and abilities will set this, and you, apart. good luck. read on.

## üåü Primary Objective

Connect the React-based frontend (Vite + Tailwind) to the Flask backend served at `0.0.0.0:5001` by implementing (or confirming) all API endpoints:

- `GET /api/files`
- `GET /api/agents`
- `GET /api/topics`

These must return real-time values from the legal discovery graph, document store, or mock data if necessary.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è File: `apps/legal_discovery/interface_flask.py`

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Add or Reuse API Endpoints

Check if these exist. If not, add them:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

@app.route("/api/files", methods=["GET"])
def get_files():
    return jsonify([
        {"name": "exhibit_a.pdf"},
        {"name": "witness_statement.txt"},
        {"name": "email_thread.eml"}
    ])

@app.route("/api/agents", methods=["GET"])
def get_agents():
    return jsonify([
        {"name": "Semantic Extractor", "active": True},
        {"name": "Evidence Vectorizer", "active": False},
        {"name": "Legal Argument Builder", "active": True}
    ])

@app.route("/api/topics", methods=["GET"])
def get_topics():
    return jsonify([
        {"label": "Due Process"},
        {"label": "Fraud on the Court"},
        {"label": "Constructive Eviction"}
    ])
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Runtime (Handled via Docker)

Ensure the container launches with:

```dockerfile
CMD ["python", "-m", "gunicorn", "-k", "eventlet", "-w", "1", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5001", "apps.legal_discovery.interface_flask:app"]
```

---

## üß™ Test the API

From within Docker:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/files
curl http://localhost:5001/api/agents
curl http://localhost:5001/api/topics
```

Confirm you receive valid JSON payloads.

---

## ü§© Frontend Integration

Make sure `Dashboard.jsx` uses these:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/files').then(res => res.json()).then(setFiles);
  fetch('/api/agents').then(res => res.json()).then(setAgents);
  fetch('/api/topics').then(res => res.json()).then(setTopics);
}, []);
```

---

## ‚úÖ Completion Criteria

-

---

## üí° Bonus Upgrades

- Use `Path("/data/evidence").glob("**/*")` for dynamic files
- Query Neo4j or Qdrant for agents/topics
- Protect routes with JWT or header-based auth

---

## üß† Output Confirmation

Gemini agents must respond with:

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "dashboard_connected": true,
  "routes_tested": true,
  "dynamic_source_pending": false,
  "reused_modules": ["agent_network.py", "graph/query_service.py"]
}
```

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `llm_agent.py`

**Path:** `backend/agents/core/llm_agent.py`  
**Update:** Inside the agent‚Äôs result construction function, modify the output like so:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def generate_agent_output(insight, score, evidence_list, agent_id):
    return {
        "finding": insight,
        "confidence": score,  # float 0.0 - 1.0, generated from your logic
        "evidence": evidence_list,
        "agent_id": agent_id,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    }
```

> Must emit real score from heuristic/model logic‚Äînever hardcoded.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `agent_routes.py`

**Path:** `backend/routes/agent_routes.py`

## Gemini Legal Discovery Platform: Masterpiece Development Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive, multi-phase plan to transform the Legal Discovery application into an unparalleled, enterprise-grade masterpiece of legal tech engineering. Our core philosophy is to embrace complexity, deliver robust and sophisticated features, and leverage cutting-edge LLM agent technology to its fullest potential. No mock code, no temporary solutions‚Äîonly production-ready, fully functional implementations.

### Current State & Initial Analysis (Post-Restart Context)

Upon restart, I will have access to the top-level directory (`G:\anaconda\anaconda3\envs\neuro-san-studio-2`), enabling a holistic view of the `neuro-san` framework and its integration. My previous frontend styling and backend API integration efforts within `apps/legal_discovery` will serve as a strong foundation.

### Phase 1: Deep Dive into `neuro-san` and LLM Agent Integration

This phase is critical for understanding and fully leveraging the `neuro-san` framework and its LLM agent capabilities.

*   **1.1. Comprehensive `neuro-san` Ecosystem Analysis:**
    *   **`legal_discovery.hocon` Deep Dive:** Thoroughly analyze the `legal_discovery.hocon` manifest to understand the defined agent networks, subnetworks, and their configurations. This includes understanding the roles, capabilities, and interconnections of each agent.
    *   **Reference Documentation Review:** Systematically review the reference documentation located in `./neuro-san-studio-2/.venv/Lib/site-packages/neuro_san`, `/neuro_san_web_client`, `/nsflow`, `/leaf_server_common`, `/leaf_common`, and any `/langchain` subdirectories. This will provide the authoritative technical specifications for proper configuration and interaction with the LLM agents.
    *   **`coded-tools/legal_discovery` Integration Verification:** Verify how the tools within `coded-tools/legal_discovery` are configured and registered with the `neuro-san` agents. Ensure that all tools are fully implemented and exposed to the agents as intended.
    *   **Backend-Framework Interoperability:** Confirm the proper configuration and registration of the backend (everything up-level of `apps/legal_discovery` that is related to legal_discovery) with the `neuro-san` framework, ensuring seamless data flow and command execution.

*   **1.2. LLM Agent Functionality Enhancement & Expansion:**
    *   **"Organize" Functionality (LLM-Driven):** Re-implement the "Organize" feature in `UploadSection.jsx` to be driven by an LLM agent. This agent will analyze document content, metadata, and potentially user-defined criteria to intelligently categorize and organize files. This will replace any rule-based or heuristic approaches with a sophisticated, adaptive classification system.
        *   **Backend API for Organization:** Develop a dedicated Flask API endpoint (`/api/organize_documents`) that accepts document IDs or paths and triggers the LLM agent for categorization. This API will return the suggested categorization and allow for user confirmation/correction.
        *   **LLM Agent Development/Configuration:** If not already present, define or extend an LLM agent within `legal_discovery.hocon` specifically for document organization. This agent will utilize advanced NLP techniques for content understanding and classification.
    *   **Proactive Agent Behaviors:** Explore and implement proactive behaviors for LLM agents. For example, an agent could automatically flag documents requiring specific legal review based on content analysis, or suggest relevant research topics based on case data.
    *   **Complex Task Orchestration:** Enhance the `legal_discovery_thinker` in `legal_discovery.py` to enable more complex, multi-step task orchestration involving multiple LLM agents and tools. This will move beyond simple request-response cycles to sophisticated workflows.

### Phase 2: Advanced Frontend Features & UI/UX Polish

Building upon the LLM agent capabilities, this phase focuses on creating a truly immersive and intelligent user experience.

*   **2.1. Intelligent Data Visualization:**
    *   **Dynamic Knowledge Graph:** Enhance the `GraphSection.jsx` to dynamically visualize relationships and insights generated by LLM agents. This includes interactive filtering, drill-down capabilities, and potentially temporal analysis of graph evolution.
    *   **Predictive Timeline:** Augment `TimelineSection.jsx` with predictive capabilities. LLM agents could analyze historical case data and suggest potential future events or critical deadlines, displayed visually on the timeline.
    *   **Smart Document Viewer:** Develop a sophisticated document viewer that integrates LLM agent insights. This could include automatic summarization of documents, identification of key entities and legal concepts, and cross-referencing with other case materials.

*   **2.2. Enhanced User Interaction & Feedback:**
    *   **Natural Language Querying (NLQ) Everywhere:** Extend NLQ capabilities beyond the chat interface to other sections, allowing users to ask complex questions about cases, documents, and tasks using natural language.
    *   **Agent-Assisted Workflow Automation:** Implement UI elements that allow users to define and trigger complex, multi-agent workflows directly from the frontend, with real-time feedback on agent progress and decisions.
    *   **Personalized Dashboards:** Develop customizable dashboards where users can configure widgets to display LLM-generated insights most relevant to their current tasks and preferences.

### Phase 3: Robustness, Scalability, and Production Readiness

This phase ensures the masterpiece is not only beautiful and intelligent but also resilient and ready for real-world deployment.

*   **3.1. Comprehensive Error Handling & Logging:**
    *   Implement advanced error handling mechanisms across both frontend and backend, providing detailed, actionable feedback to users and comprehensive logging for debugging.
    *   Integrate monitoring and alerting for agent performance and system health.

*   **3.2. Performance Optimization:**
    *   Optimize database queries and API responses for speed and efficiency, especially for large datasets.
    *   Implement caching strategies where appropriate to reduce load on backend services and LLM agents.

*   **3.3. Security & Compliance:**
    *   Conduct a thorough security audit of the entire application, addressing any vulnerabilities.
    *   Ensure compliance with relevant legal and data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

*   **3.4. Advanced Deployment & Orchestration:**
    *   Refine Docker configurations for optimal performance and resource utilization in a production environment.
    *   Explore and implement advanced deployment strategies (e.g., Kubernetes, serverless functions) to ensure scalability and high availability.

### Execution Strategy:

I will proceed iteratively, focusing on one feature or enhancement at a time, ensuring each component is fully functional and integrated before moving to the next. Regular self-verification through testing and internal checks will be paramount. I will communicate progress and any necessary adjustments to this plan.

This is the vision for the Legal Discovery Platform. I am ready to build this masterpiece.
